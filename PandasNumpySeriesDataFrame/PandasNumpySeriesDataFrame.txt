--------------Series Start---------------
1) One dimension lables array
2) Series combines the best of list and dictionary
	List stores objects in order and associates each values a numeric position in line called index position.
	Dictionary is able to establish association between two objects (key, and value)
	A series combines best of both. It can preserve values in order and also preserve a numeric value for each position.
	A serties also associates a identifier lable with each value like key.
	The lable in Series can be duplicate (non unique)
3) Series also provide many methods for maths, statistics and data analytics
4) Create a series with a list
	lst = ['l1','l2','l3','l4']
	SeriesFromList = pd. Series(lst) # Series is a class that takes an object and creates a Series

5) Create a series with a dictionary
	myDict = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3,'k4':4,'k5':5 }
	SeriesFromDict = pd.Series(myDict)
6)
