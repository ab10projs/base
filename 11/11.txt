1)Sets
1.1) sets are used to define the concept of relations and functions
1.2) sets are also used in sudy of geometry, sequences, probability
1.3) collection of objects of a particular kind. A well defined collection of objects. 
We can clearly define if a particular object belongs to that set.
1.4) If a belongs to set A epsilon A
1.5) {} is empty set
1.6) subset
1.7) set of all subsets of a set is called power of a set
1.8) If a set has m elements, then the power of this set is 2^m
1.9) Venn, union and intersections

2) Relations and Functions
2.1) cartesian product of tw sets A and B is .. All elements of A multiplied by All elements of set B
2.2) The order of pair formed by cartesian product is crucial. 
(DL, MP, KA) * (1,2,3) will give (DL,1),(DL,2),(DL,3),(MP,1),(MP,2),MP3),(KA,1),(KA,2), (KA,3).. KA,3 <> 3,KA
2.2.1) Two ordered pairs are equal, then first element is same in both pairs and also second element is same in both pairs
2.2.2) if there are p elements in A and q elements in B, then there will be pq elements in AXB.
2.2.3) orderd triplets {a,b,c} in AXAXA if all a,b and c belong to A
Relation:

3) Trignometric Functions
3.1) Units of measurement of angles
3.1.1) Degree:	1 Degree of full revolution = 1/360
3.1.2) Radian:	A circle of 1 unit is the one that has 1 unit radius (1 cm, 1m etc).

The circumference of a unit circle is 2*pi, so one complete rotation subtends 2*pi radians at center.
As an arc of length r subtends 1 radian, an arc of length l will subtend l/r radians. 

3.2.1) Relation between degree and radian
3.2.2) A unit circle subtends 2*pi radians at centre
If the radius is 1 cm(unit circle), then the angle subtended by an arc of 1 unit(equal to radius) at the center is 1 radian.
Approx 6.28 arcs equal to radius make the circumference , which is = 2pi by formula of circumfernce 2*pi*r, so pi= approx 3.14 or (22/7)  
Approx 6.28 arcs of length equal to radius complete the circumference of an circle, so 1 radian approx 57.69 degree.
3.2.3) Some important Degree:Radian realtions are 30Degree=pi/6, 45Degree=pi/4 , 60Degree=pi/3

So Angles can be measured in degree or Radians
Angle is represented as Theta 
Radian is represented as Beta (pi are raidan measures, and while writing, the word radian is omitted).. Example--> 180 = pi ... Here word radian after pi is omited.
Example: 6 radians = 348degree + 38minutes + 10.9 seconds

3.3.3) Trignometric Functions
sin x = 0   implies  x = n*pi where n is any integer (integer is any +ve or -ve number which is not fraction)
cos x = 0   implies  x = (2n +1) * pi/2   ... (2n+1) are all odd numbers for integer value of n 
cosec x = 1/sin x, where x not equal to n*pi
sec x = 1/cos x, where x not equal to (2n+1)pi*2
tan x = sin x/ cos x,  where x not equal to (2n+1)pi*2
cot x = cos x/ sin x, where x not equal to n*pi

3.3.4) sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1
3.3.5) 1 + tan^2 x= sec^2 x
3.3.6) 1 + cot^2 x = cosec^2 x

3.4) Sign of trigonometric function
3.4.1)  Sin is + in 1st and 2nd quardants... Cos is +ve in 1st and 4th Quardant
cos in +in 1st and 4th quardant, because cos x = base/hyp and base is +in 1st and 4th and hyp is always +ve
sin is + in 1st and 2nd quardant, because perpendecular is + in 1st and 2nd and hyp is always +ve
3.5) Domain and Range of trignometric functions
sin and cos are defined for all real numbers
3.5.1) -1 <= sin x <= 1 ... Thus domain of  y= sin x is ALL real numbers and range is in the interval -1 to 1
3.5.2) -1 <= cos x <= 1 ... Thus domain of  y= cos x is ALL real numbers and range is in the interval -1 to 1

3.6) Trignometric Functions of Sums and Difference of two angles
cos (-x) = cos x  ... as -x is in 4th quardrant.. from o, -x will be down in 4th quardrant
sin (-x) = -sin x 
3.7) proof of cos(x+y) = cos x * cos y -(sin x * sin y)

### Distance formaula for two coordinaes (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) ... d= underroot[ (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 ]
1) cos(x+y) = cos x * cos y -(sin x * sin y)
2) cos(x-y) = cos x * cos y +(sin x * sin y)
3) ... complete rest 

3.8) Trignometric Equations
Equations involving trignometric functions of a variable.
values of sin x , cos x repeat after an interval of 2pi and value of tan repeats after interval of pi.

3.8.1) Solution of trignometric equation for which 0<=x<=2pi is called general solution.   
Z denotes integers
