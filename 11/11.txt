1)Sets


Natural Numbers: 	All counting numbers from 1 (1,2,3,4...) not fractions..
Whole Number:	 	0+ Natural numbers
Integers:		Whole numbers and their -ve from -infinity to +infinity
Rational Numbers:	p/q where q<>0
Irrational Number:	can not be expressed as p/q where q<>0
Real Nmbers: 		Rational + Irrational numbers	


1.1) sets are used to define the concept of relations and functions
1.2) sets are also used in sudy of geometry, sequences, probability
1.3) collection of objects of a particular kind. A well defined collection of objects. 
We can clearly define if a particular object belongs to that set.
1.4) If a belongs to set A epsilon A
1.5) There are 2 ways of representing a set. (Roster or tabular form... and.... set-builder)
1.6) Roster {1,2,3,4,5}.. Here the order in which elements appear does not matter.. so this set can be written as {2,1,3,4,5}
1.7) In Roster form the elements are not repeated..
1.8) In Setbuilder form, all elements of set have some common property... like all vowels. v= {x:x is a vowel}.
1.9) {} is empty set.. or empty set or void set.
1.10) if all elements of 2 sets are same, then the two sets are equal.
1.11) The set of real numbers >a and <b is a open set, as the end points(a and b) are not included.{y: a< y <b }... [a,b]
1.12) If both end points are included, then set is called closed .. { y: a<= y <=b }
1.13) Set can be closed from one end and open from other  ... { y: a< y <=b }
1.14) Power Set: a set of all subsets is power of a set.. For set A{1,2}, power P(A) = {null,{1},{2},{1,2}} ..
1.15) Universal Set: The basic set is called Universal set. All its subsets are called A,B,C.. 


2) Relations and Functions
2.1) cartesian product of two sets A and B is .. All elements of A multiplied by All elements of set B
2.2) The order of pair formed by cartesian product is crucial. 
(DL, MP, KA) * (1,2,3) will give (DL,1),(DL,2),(DL,3),(MP,1),(MP,2),MP3),(KA,1),(KA,2), (KA,3).. KA,3 <> 3,KA 
2.2.1) Two ordered pairs are equal, then first element is same in both pairs and also second element is same in both pairs
2.2.2) if there are p elements in A and q elements in B, then there will be pq elements in AXB.
2.2.3) orderd triplets {a,b,c} in AXAXA if all a,b and c belong to A





3) Trignometric Functions
3.1) Units of measurement of angles
3.1.1) Degree:	1 Degree of full revolution = 1/360.  1 degree=(360/2*pi) radian
3.1.2) Radian:	A circle of 1 unit is the one that has 1 unit radius (1 cm, 1m etc). A unit circle subtends 2*pi radians at centre,so 1 radian approx 57.69 degree.

The circumference of a unit circle is 2*pi, so one complete rotation subtends 2*pi radians at center.
As an arc of length r subtends 1 radian, an arc of length l will subtend l/r radians. 

3.2.1) Relation between degree and radian
3.2.2) A unit circle subtends 2*pi radians at centre
If the radius is 1 cm(unit circle), then the angle subtended by an arc of 1 unit(equal to radius) at the center is 1 radian.
Approx 6.28 arcs equal to radius make the circumference , which is = 2pi by formula of circumfernce 2*pi*r, so pi= approx 3.14 or (22/7)  
Approx 6.28 arcs of length equal to radius complete the circumference of an circle, so 1 radian approx 57.69 degree.
3.2.3) Some important Degree:Radian realtions are 30Degree=pi/6, 45Degree=pi/4 , 60Degree=pi/3

So Angles can be measured in degree or Radians
Angle is represented as Theta 
Radian is represented as Beta (pi are raidan measures, and while writing, the word radian is omitted).. Example--> 180 = pi ... Here word radian after pi is omited.
Example: 6 radians = 348degree + 38minutes + 10.9 seconds

3.3.3) Trignometric Functions
sin x = 0   implies  x = n*pi where n is any integer (integer is any +ve or -ve number which is not fraction)
cos x = 0   implies  x = (2n +1) * pi/2   ... (2n+1) are all odd numbers for integer value of n 
cosec x = 1/sin x, where x not equal to n*pi
sec x = 1/cos x, where x not equal to (2n+1)pi*2
tan x = sin x/ cos x,  where x not equal to (2n+1)pi*2
cot x = cos x/ sin x, where x not equal to n*pi

3.3.4) sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1
3.3.5) 1 + tan^2 x= sec^2 x
3.3.6) 1 + cot^2 x = cosec^2 x

3.4) Sign of trigonometric function
3.4.1)  Sin is + in 1st and 2nd quardants... Cos is +ve in 1st and 4th Quardant
cos in +in 1st and 4th quardant, because cos x = base/hyp and base is +in 1st and 4th and hyp is always +ve
sin is + in 1st and 2nd quardant, because perpendecular is + in 1st and 2nd and hyp is always +ve
3.5) Domain and Range of trignometric functions
sin and cos are defined for all real numbers
3.5.1) -1 <= sin x <= 1 ... Thus domain of  y= sin x is ALL real numbers and range is in the interval -1 to 1
3.5.2) -1 <= cos x <= 1 ... Thus domain of  y= cos x is ALL real numbers and range is in the interval -1 to 1

3.6) Trignometric Functions of Sums and Difference of two angles
cos (-x) = cos x  ... as -x is in 4th quardrant.. from o, -x will be down in 4th quardrant
sin (-x) = -sin x 
3.7) proof of cos(x+y) = cos x * cos y -(sin x * sin y)

### Distance formaula for two coordinaes (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) ... d= underroot[ (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 ]

1) sin (-x) = -sin(x) ... As -x is -ve angle, it moves to the clockwise and comes in quadrant 4, where sin is -ve
2) cos (-x) = cos(x) ...  As -x is -ve angle, it moves to the clockwise and comes in quadrant 4, where cos is +ve
3) cos(x+y) = cos x * cos y -(sin x * sin y)
3) cos(x-y) = cos x * cos y +(sin x * sin y)
4) cos(pi/2 -x) = sin x 
5) sin (pi/2 -x) = cos x
6) sin(x+y) = sin(x) * cos(y) + cos(x)*sin(y)
7) sin(x-y) = sin(x) * cos(y) - cos(x)*sin(y)
8)  


3.8) Trignometric Equations
Equations involving trignometric functions of a variable.
values of sin x , cos x repeat after an interval of 2pi and value of tan repeats after interval of pi.

3.8.1) Solution of trignometric equation for which 0<=x<=2pi is called general solution.   
Z denotes integers

7) Permutation and Combination
	
In an event can happen in m different ways, followed by another event that can happen in n different ways, then total number of events in given order are m*n
7.1) In permutation order of arrangements is important
7.2) Different possible arrangements of word ROSE in permutation means: Arrangemen of 4 alphabets, all taken at a time. 
7.3) 3 Different words that can be formed from words NUMBER without repeat means... Permutation of 6 different alphabets(as NUMBER has 6 alphabets), taken 3 at a time
6*5*4 = 120 (without repeat) and 6*6*6 = 216 (with repeat)
A permutation is an arrangement in definate order of some objects all taken at  time 
("all taken at a time" means these objet's arrangemet should be considered together 

***  0! =1
n!  = 1*2*3*4*5*...*(n-1)*n
7.4) ALL OBJECTS ARE DISTINCT 
	7.5) The number of permutaions of n distinct objects, taken r at a time where 0<=r<=n, is as below:
		IF REPETITION IS NOT ALLOWED
			nPr =  n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-r+1)
			nPr = n!/(n-r)!   .................  Repetition is not allowed (and ALL OBJECTS ARE DISTINCT)
 
		IF REPETITION IS ALLOWED
			permutation of n objects taken r at a time when repetition is allowed is nPOWERr .................... 
			Here Repetition is allowed (and ALL OBJECTS ARE DISTINCT)
7.5) ALL OBJECTS ARE NOT DISTINCT (example ROOT, where there are 2 Os, which are considered of same kind). Here 2 objects are of same kind
	Number of permutations of n objects , where p are of 'one-type' is --> (n!)/(p!)
		If p1 are of 'one-type' , p2 are of second-type' and p3 of 'thrird type' ... --> (n!)/((p1 !)*(p2 !)* (p3 !)
  

A combination is an arrangement where order is NOT IMPORTANT
	nPr = nCr * r!
	so
	nCr = nPr/r! = n!/[(n-r)! *(r)!]
