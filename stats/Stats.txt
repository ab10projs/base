1)
2) Grouping and displaying
2.1) Data Array
2.2) Frequency distribution is a better way of data display w.r.t arrays
2.2.1) Classes of some interval are created and the count of elements (frequency) is callacualed
2.2.2) Relative frequency distribution has the % or values of class, and add to 100% for all classes
2.2.2.1) Steps for frequency distribution
a) Decide number of classes
b) calculate the width of class
c) sort the values and count number of entries per class
d) Histograms and Frquency polygones.. Ogives show relative frequency


3) Measures of entral Tendency and Dispersion in Frequency
3.1) Central Tendency: Middle point of a distribution
3.2) Dispersion is spread of data (level to which the values are scattered
3.3) skewness: (Symmetrical or skewed). Skewed to left means long tail is on left side.
3.4) Kurttois: Peakedness. 
3.5) Charactersticts of samples are called statistics
3.6) Charactersticts of population are called parameters

#---------Ungrouped Data starts -------------#
3.7) μ = Σx/N (population) , where (N is number of elements in population)  and (Σx is sum of values of all observations)
3.8) x̄ = Σx/n (sample)
3.9) Disadvantages of Averages
1) impacted by extream values
2) tedious for large values
3) not possible in open interval classes

3.10) When the number of observations are large, then for ease of calculation some accuracy is given up by gouping values in classes
Step1) We decideon the number of classes in which all values are to be divided.
Step2) We find mid point of each class
Step3) We multiply mid point with frequency of each class, where frequency is the number of values in each class.
x̄ = Σ(frequencyOfEachClass*midPointOfClass)/numberOfObservations             .. here numberOfObservations = ΣfrequencyOfEachClass

Weighted mean given importance to each value based on its weight
x̄weighted = Σ(w*x)/w    .. where w is weight assigned to each observation


as we know .. If  aPOWERn = b  then  a = n√b
Geometric Mean
Sometimes values change over time. We need to know "average rate of change" .. like growth rate. 
GM = n√(a1*a2*a3*.... an)
used with ratios, %change, rate of change




Harmonic mean
square(GM) = AM * HM
AM = (a+b)/2
GM = √(a*b)
HM = 2*ab/(a+b)
HM= n/[(1/r1)+(1/r2)+(1/r3)]

Medean
(n+1)/2

Mode
Mo= LowLimOfModalClass + (d1/(d1+d2))w 
here w is width
d1= frequecy of modal class - frequency of modela class directly below it
d2= frequecy of modal class - frequency of modela class directly above it


Range
diffrece between lowest and highest value
fractile divides all values in 3 parts
quartile divides all values in 4 parts
decile   divides all values in 10 parts

#---------Grouped Data   ends -------------#


DISPERSION
It gives additional information of how reliable is the central tendency value. If the dispersion is wide, then central value is not very strong representative of data

UNGROUPED DATA
σ2 = Σ ( Xi – μ )2 / N
σ = Population Standard Deviation
z Population standard score = (x-μ)/σ

Variance of GROUPED DATA
σ2 = Σf(x-μ)squared/N


SAMPLE Variance
sPower2 = Σ (x-x̄)Power2  / n-1
s = Sample Standard deviation

Standard score tells how many standard deviations away is any value from its mean

SDs of two samples cannot be compared, so we have to convert SD in terms if percentage.
Cofficiant of variation expresses SD as percent of mean. It is a ratio so it does not have a unit.
Population covariance = σ/μ

#----------------------  Probability Ch4 starts ------------------------------------------------------
There are two broad types of problems
A) Deterministc (frequency distribution and or discriptive statistics is used)
B) Probabilistic (Random)  (Probability and probability distributions are used)

Sample Space: It is a set of all outcoms
Event: A desirable outcome
Experiment: An activity that produces an Event

There are THREE TYPES OF CLASSIFYING PROBABILITIES
1) CLASSICAL APPROACH (also know as priori)
2) RELARIVE FREQUENCY APPROACH
3) SUBJECTIVE APPROACH

Classical Probability:
Probability of an Event = (number of outcomes where event occured)/total number os events  ...  Here each outcome is equally likely
It is also called prori as we can tell the answer without actually doing experiment. This approach assumes very orderly situations and may not be fit for many real life
Here WITH REPLACEMENT OR WITHOUT REPLACEMENT is important.


RELATIVE FREQUENCY:
If 'f' is the frequency of happening of an event in N trials, then relative frequency = f/N
The observed relative frequecy of an event in very large number of trials. The proportion of times an event occurs in long run under stable conditions.
The relative frequency becoes stable when number of experiments become very large.
Here it is required to do large number of experiments.
The cost of experiments may increase ,so we need to be careful.
In this category, the assumption of all events being equally likely and mutually exclusive is not present.
Disadvantage is that the event should repeat itself after some trials and it is not sure if event stabalizes after some experiments.
In real life, events many not have occured many times and data may not be available to use it.

SUBJECTIVE APPROACH:
These are probabilities assigned to events by person based on educated guess or any evidence available.

P(A) means probability of event A happening.  It is also called marginal or unconditional probability.
ADDITIONAL RULE OF PROBABILISTIC EVENTS If two events are NOT mutually exclusive : P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(AB)  .. This -P(AB) is to remove double count
ADDITIONAL RULE OF PROBABILISTIC EVENTS If two events ARE mutually exclusive : P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)


JOINT PROBABILITIES UNDER STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE:
The probability of two or more events happening together or in succession is product of their marginal probability.
Joint probability of two independent events:  P(AB) = P(A) * P(B)  ... Here P(AB) is probability of event A and B happening together or in succession.

CONDITIONAL PROBABILITIES UNDER STATSTICAL INDEPENDENCE:
P(B|A)  .. Probability of event B given that event A has happened
