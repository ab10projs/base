1)
2) Grouping and displaying
2.1) Data Array
2.2) Frequency distribution is a better way of data display w.r.t arrays
2.2.1) Classes of some interval are created and the count of elements (frequency) is callacualed
2.2.2) Relative frequency distribution has the % or values of class, and add to 100% for all classes
2.2.2.1) Steps for frequency distribution
a) Decide number of classes
b) calculate the width of class
c) sort the values and count number of entries per class
d) Histograms and Frquency polygones.. Ogives show relative frequency


3) Measures of entral Tendency and Dispersion in Frequency
3.1) Central Tendency: Middle point of a distribution
3.2) Dispersion is spread of data (level to which the values are scattered
3.3) skewness: (Symmetrical or skewed). Skewed to left means long tail is on left side.
3.4) Kurttois: Peakedness. 
3.5) Charactersticts of samples are called statistics
3.6) Charactersticts of population are called parameters

#---------Ungrouped Data starts -------------#
3.7) μ = Σx/N (population) , where (N is number of elements in population)  and (Σx is sum of values of all observations)
3.8) x̄ = Σx/n (sample)
3.9) Disadvantages of Averages
1) impacted by extream values
2) tedious for large values
3) not possible in open interval classes

3.10) When the number of observations are large, then for ease of calculation some accuracy is given up by gouping values in classes
Step1) We decideon the number of classes in which all values are to be divided.
Step2) We find mid point of each class
Step3) We multiply mid point with frequency of each class, where frequency is the number of values in each class.
x̄ = Σ(frequencyOfEachClass*midPointOfClass)/numberOfObservations             .. here numberOfObservations = ΣfrequencyOfEachClass

Weighted mean given importance to each value based on its weight
x̄weighted = Σ(w*x)/w    .. where w is weight assigned to each observation


as we know .. If  aPOWERn = b  then  a = n√b
Geometric Mean
Sometimes values change over time. We need to know "average rate of change" .. like growth rate. 
GM = n√(a1*a2*a3*.... an)
used with ratios, %change, rate of change




Harmonic mean
square(GM) = AM * HM
AM = (a+b)/2
GM = √(a*b)
HM = 2*ab/(a+b)
HM= n/[(1/r1)+(1/r2)+(1/r3)]

Medean
(n+1)/2

Mode
Mo= LowLimOfModalClass + (d1/(d1+d2))w 
here w is width
d1= frequecy of modal class - frequency of modela class directly below it
d2= frequecy of modal class - frequency of modela class directly above it


Range
diffrece between lowest and highest value
fractile divides all values in 3 parts
quartile divides all values in 4 parts
decile   divides all values in 10 parts

σ

DISPERSION
It gives additional information of how reliable is the central tendency value. If the dispersion is wide, then central value is not very strong representative of data
