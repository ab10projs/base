1)
2) Grouping and displaying
2.1) Data Array
2.2) Frequency distribution is a better way of data display w.r.t arrays
2.2.1) Classes of some interval are created and the count of elements (frequency) is callacualed
2.2.2) Relative frequency distribution has the % or values of class, and add to 100% for all classes
2.2.2.1) Steps for frequency distribution
a) Decide number of classes
b) calculate the width of class
c) sort the values and count number of entries per class
d) Histograms and Frquency polygones.. Ogives show relative frequency


3) Measures of entral Tendenccy and Dispersion in Frequency
3.1) Central Tendency: Middle point of a distribution
3.2) Dispersion is spread of data (level to which the values are scattered
3.3) skewness: (Symmetrical or skewed). Skewed to left means long tail is on left side.
3.4) Kurttois: Peakedness. 
3.5) Charactersticts of samples are called statistics
3.6) Charactersticts of population are called parameters
3.7) mu = Sigma(x)/N (population)
3.8) xbar = sigma(x)/n (sample)
3.9) Disadvantages of Averages
1) impacted by extream values
2) tedious for large values
3) not possible in open interval classes
